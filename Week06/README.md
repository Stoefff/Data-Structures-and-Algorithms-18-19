### Seminar - 07.11.18

### For the exam
We have a 30 minutes for every data structure
Do not write template classes, because most likely

### Append vs merge
Append is just concatenating of elements
Merge is when we have two sorted array and we make a new merged one which is
sorted

### Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
Way of writing the the math operations without the need of brackets  
The same thing Semerdiev told us  
Example:
`5*(3+4) = 5 3 4 + *`

## Slow sorting algorithm

### Important characteristics of a sorting algorithm
* Time Complexity
* Space Complexity
* Stability
* Number of swaps
* Number of comparisons
* Adaptivity

### Stability of an algorithms
How algorithm handles equals values
Example with sorting algorithms:  
If we compare equals values, a sorting algorithm is a stable if
it does not swap equal values

### Adaptivity
How the algorithms handles specific behavior like nearly sorted array

### Bubble sort -write characteristics

### Selection sort

### Insertion sort

### Lecture 07.11.18

## Unit testing
Gives us the ability to test a small portion of possibly big program without
shitting on the code and without messing with the whole program just to test
a small part of the code

### Practice - 12.11.18
