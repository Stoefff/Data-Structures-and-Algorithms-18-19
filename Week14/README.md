## Classes of Algorithms

### Backtracking algorithm
* Idea: we explore the tree of possible solution and backtrack
when a branch of that tree does not have any solutions
* Example: DFS, 8 queens problem, The walk of the Knights
* Optimizes all solution probing

### Divide and conquer
* Idea: Splitting the problems and then joining the solution
* Example: Merge Sort, Binary Search, Quick Search

### Dynamic programing/optimizing
* Idea: **Set cover** of the problem
* Example: Dikstra, Belman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
* Intuition: Just like ИО - we start and find the optimized value
of a first parameter, we use this value to calculate the
optimized value of a second parameter and so on until
we optimize all the parameters

### Memorization - subbranch of dynamic programing
* Idea:

### Еверистичен алгоритъм:
* Idea: optimizes the algorithm by making guesses which branch
in the tree of solution contains the best global solution
* Making guess for the global guess

### Greedy algorithms  - subbranch of ^
* Idea: optimizes the algorithm by continuing with the best current
branch in the tree of solution(the current branch most likely is not
the best global)
* Choosing the local(current) best

### Depth Bond Search

### Level incrementing search

### Best First Search

### Beam search

### Hill climbing search
