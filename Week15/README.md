### Final seminar - 16.01.19

### OxyGen
* Generates documentation with the help of comments
* Avaliable on many languages
* Generates many types of documentation
* Used everywhere in corporate environment

### Some more topics from Vanaka - 04.02.19

### Building BTS from a heap
* Building a sorted array from a heap - O(log(n))
* Building a BST from a sorted array - O(n)
* Overall time complexity -  O(n*log(n))

### Finding connected components  from a graph
Done by using BFS/DFS for all the graph vertex
and storing the index of the connected component
in the vertex or in mapping container outside

### Graph complexity
**In general all the complexity for all the representation
are calculated with a check operation to see if the things
is already added/remove in the graph**

### Sorting lists
* Insertion - Iterating through the list and swapping nodes which is done
with a lot of pointer swapping
* Merge sort - some optimizations - when one of the head pointers becomes
`nullptr`, instead of push-backing all the elements of the remaining
head, we just make the end pointer of the merged list to be the
start pointer of the remaining header list
